          Welcome to BudgeVoyage, our innovative travel planning web app! We
          understand that planning a trip can be stressful, especially when it
          comes to staying within a budget. That's why we've designed a simple
          and easy-to-use platform that guides you through a set of questions
          and populates a set of cards with flights and hotel options that match
          your budget. You can then choose to like or dislike the cards
          presented. When satisfied with both BudgeVoyage will create a travel
          package you can then add to your Bucketlist. Bucketlist is where all
          your chosen packages are stored.
